i need to have the y position calculate in 2 ways

every block will have a number, rank, an integer which is their position from the bottom

in this way, i can calculate its height by a combination of LN# and rank

ie. LN#*5 + rank*2

this way, all the blocks of a line are grouped together, and the spaces between lines is preserved

BUT the second way

is to calculate a 2nd LN# which is really the LINERANK

so if you had lines 2, 6, 7 total, they would be ranked as 1, 2, 3


the same equation would work

This way, we can draw using line and rank, or one or the other

/* how to group?

ie. production.line.rank

gantt.line.rank?
